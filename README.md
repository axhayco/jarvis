# J.A.R.V.I.S.

A browser voice assistant with an Iron Man holographic interface. Say
**"Hey Jarvis"**, he wakes, listens, and does real things through your tools —
searches the web, generates images, drives your phone, reads your mail. The face
is a web page (React + Vite + Three.js + custom GLSL). The brain is Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`),
run via the Node bridge server.

**Powered by Google Gemini.** Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and place it in `.env.local` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`. **ElevenLabs is an optional add-on** that
gives JARVIS a much better voice and sharper hearing; without it he speaks and
listens through the browser's own speech, and everything still works.

---

## Requirements

- **Gemini API key** — get a free key from <https://aistudio.google.com/> and put `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` in `.env.local`.
- **Node.js 20 or newer** — free, one installer from <https://nodejs.org>.
- **Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge**, in a **real browser window** — not an
  embedded preview pane.
- **Optional: an ElevenLabs API key** — optional add-on for enhanced voice and transcription.

Run `npm run setup` after cloning and it checks all of this for you, in plain
language.

---

## Quick start

First, install, then start it:

```bash
npm install
npm start          # runs the brain and the face together
```

Then open the URL it prints (http://localhost:5173) in **Chrome**, click **INITIALISE**, and say **“Hey Jarvis”**.

Prefer two terminals? Run them separately instead:

```bash
npm install
```

Terminal 1 — the brain:

```bash
npm run bridge
```

Terminal 2 — the face:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the app in a **real Chrome or Edge window**:

```bash
open http://localhost:5173
```

Click **INITIALISE**, allow the microphone when asked, and say **"Hey Jarvis"**.

> It has to be a real browser window. Embedded preview panes block the
> microphone, so JARVIS will look perfectly alive and simply never respond.

---

## How it works

JARVIS is two processes. The browser is the face and the voice; the bridge is
the brain and the hands.

```

```

Everything you see and hear happens in the browser. The bridge is a single Node
process (`bridge/server.mjs`) powered by **Google Gemini** (`gemini-2.5-flash`).
They talk over a WebSocket (plus a few HTTP endpoints) on `ws://localhost:8787`.

**Why a bridge at all?** A browser tab cannot spawn local tools or perform secure operations safely.
The bridge can. Authenticates via your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.

**The model.** `gemini-2.5-flash` by default. Override with `JARVIS_MODEL` in `.env.local` if needed.

### The voice pipeline

The loop is designed so that nothing silently dies and barge-in feels natural.

- **Detection is local.** An energy-based voice-activity detector
  (`src/lib/vad.ts`) decides when you are speaking. It is instant, cannot quietly
  fail, and is what makes **barge-in** work — speak while JARVIS is talking and he
  stops.
- **Transcription has two tiers, chosen automatically at boot.** The browser asks
  the bridge `/health` and picks the best available:
  - **ElevenLabs key present** → ElevenLabs Scribe, via the bridge `/stt` endpoint.
  - **Nothing configured** → the browser's own `SpeechRecognition` (Chrome/Edge),
    guarded by a heartbeat so it recovers when Chrome throttles it.
- **Speaking** uses the **ElevenLabs voice when a key is present**, and the
  browser's `speechSynthesis` otherwise. If a cloud call fails it falls back to
  the browser voice, and if the OS voice itself is broken it latches over to the
  cloud voice.

So it works with no keys and auto-upgrades when a key appears — there is no flag
to set. Capability detection lives in `src/lib/capabilities.ts`, which probes the
bridge's `GET /health` (returning `{ ok, tts, stt }`, both tracking the
ElevenLabs key) once at boot and picks the engines.

## What JARVIS can do

Beyond answering, JARVIS reaches integrated tools, vision, display panels, and controls his own interface.

### Tools & Capabilities

- **Web & search** — Google search, web page text reading
- **Display & HUD** — Custom holographic HUD panels, blades, and visual widgets
- **Voice** — ElevenLabs or Web Speech API
- **The browser** — Chrome automation tools

### JARVIS controls the interface

He drives the UI through MCP tools the bridge exposes:

- `ui_theme` — accent, background, per-phase colours
- `ui_reactor` — colour, scale, intensity, spin, and style (`ring` | `sphere` | `wire`), visibility
- `ui_orbit` — put images in orbit around the reactor
- `ui_chrome` — show or hide rails, transcript, badges
- `ui_effect` — `glitch` | `pulse` | `scan` | `shake` | `flash`
- `ui_screen` — clear
- `ui_reset` — back to defaults

So *"make it red, hide the systems list, put that render in orbit"* is a spoken
command.

### The heads-up display

JARVIS authors panels with a `display` tool against a fixed `.hud-*` design
system. The browser sanitises the markup (DOMPurify, a class allowlist and a
strict CSP) before rendering. Rich media works — images, `<video>`, and
YouTube/Vimeo embeds. Remote images and video are fetched **server-side** through
the bridge (`/img` and `/media`, both SSRF-guarded), so hotlink-blocked news
thumbnails still appear and the page never beacons your IP to a host the model
chose.

## Controls

| Key / phrase | Does |
|---|---|
| **"Hey Jarvis"** | Wake him |
| **Space** | Talk without the wake word |
| Just speak | Interrupt him mid-sentence (barge-in) |
| **V** | Cycle the browser voice |
| **Escape** | Stand down |
| **D** | Live diagnostics panel |
| **T** | One-line audio self-test |

---

## The boot sequence

Power-up plays a four-beat Iron Man start-up (`src/ui/Boot.tsx`): an
"INITIATING SYSTEM" status bar with a segmented progress bar and boot log; then
concentric reticle rings resolving into "J.A.R.V.I.S"; then a suit schematic;
then the triangular arc reactor lighting up — with a start-up sound under it
(`public/audio/boot-music.mp3`).

---

## Configuration

Everything is optional in bridge mode. Frontend settings live in `.env.local`
(copy `.env.example`); bridge settings are environment variables.

### Bridge

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `JARVIS_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8787` | Port for the WebSocket + HTTP endpoints |
| `JARVIS_MODEL` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Model to run |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | — | Google Gemini API key from AI Studio |
| `JARVIS_ALLOW_WRITES` | off | `1` allows effectful tools (see below) |
| `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | local dev | Extra WebSocket origins to accept |
| `JARVIS_ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN` | off | Accept connections with no `Origin` header |
| `JARVIS_FILE_ROOTS` | — | Roots the `/file` endpoint may serve from |
| `JARVIS_VOICE_ID` | — | ElevenLabs voice id |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | — | Optional; enables the ElevenLabs voice + Scribe |

### Frontend (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VITE_BACKEND` | `bridge` (default) or `direct` |
| `VITE_BRIDGE_URL` | Where to reach the bridge |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini API key |
| `VITE_TTS_ENGINE` | `system` or `kokoro` |
| `VITE_KOKORO_VOICE` | Voice for the Kokoro engine |
| `VITE_USE_ELEVENLABS` | Force the ElevenLabs voice on |

### Adding an ElevenLabs key

You do not have to touch a flag. Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `.env.local` or environment before starting the bridge.
Either way, `/health` starts reporting the capability, the browser picks it up on
the next boot, and both the voice and transcription upgrade automatically.

---

## Enabling actions

The tool gate starts **read-only**. Search, generation and lookups run freely;
anything effectful — send, tap, delete, install, pay — is denied. Voice is a poor
interface for a confirmation dialog, so the decision is made ahead of time in
`decideTool()` in `bridge/server.mjs`, not at the moment of use. The bridge sets
`settingSources: []`, which makes its own gate the only authority — filesystem
settings and any global `bypassPermissions` cannot override it.

To allow effectful tools (phone, browser driving, sending), run the bridge this
way instead:

```bash
npm run bridge:writes
```

> Read `decideTool()` before you do. *"Hey Jarvis, clean up my downloads folder"*
> means something rather different with writes enabled.

---

## Troubleshooting

**I can't hear him, or he can't hear me.** Press **D** for the diagnostics panel
— it states plainly whether he is hearing you and whether he is producing sound.
Press **T** for a one-line audio self-test.

**No voice at all.** You must be in **Chrome or Edge**, in a **real browser
window** (not an embedded preview), and you must have **allowed the microphone**.

**Bridge not reachable.** Check that `npm run bridge` is still running in its
terminal, and that nothing else is holding port `8787`.

---

## Security

All of this lives in `bridge/server.mjs`:

- The WebSocket accepts only local dev origins (add more with
  `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
- `/file`, `/img` and `/media` validate the scheme, confine to allowed roots,
  resolve the real path, and refuse private and loopback addresses (SSRF guard).
- The tool gate (`decideTool`) is default-deny for effectful MCP tools.
- A strict CSP in `index.html`; model-authored panel HTML is sanitised.
